# **gdrive**
## File management for Google Drive using python

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/gdrive/badge/?version=latest)](https://gdrive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

gdrive helps users to easilty access files from Google Drive using paths, instead of File ids. Google API requires the users to know the File ID to access it, but this package which is built using the pyDrive package allows users to use a file path to access the file or folder.

In addition to this, the package also provides commands that can be called from a terminal, like cd, ls, pull or push, to quickly view, modify, download or upload files from or to Google drive using a python code or just the command line.
